# Decaf Utilities

This is my little playground project for practicing Test Driven Development.

In the [cmp](src/main/java/com/bensler/decaf/util/cmp) package there are some almost trivial but nevertheless usefull classes around `java.util.Comparator`. Tests can be found [there](src/test/java/com/bensler/decaf/util/cmp).

And the [tree](src/main/java/com/bensler/decaf/util/tree) package is about a collection (like `ArrayList` or `HashMap`) that deals with objects being in a hierarchical or tree like order. Tests are [there](src/test/java/com/bensler/decaf/util/tree).
